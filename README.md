# Å»URNAL - basic running journal

## General info
### The whole project is for learning purposes only. 
At the start of 2022 I decided to start my journey in web development. Because of that I needed some space to practice my coding in "more advanced" enviroment.
Since I'm a running enthusiast I decided to create a website that tracks my yearly progress. (Let's be real. The world doesn't need another great calculator :D).

## Technologies 
Let's say I use plain html, css and js.
Other than that I decided to use Sass. Also I'm currently learning React so the technologies should expand along with my knowledge. :)

## On the less serious note:
This project to me is more like a sandbox where I can test my freshly aquired knowledge. Don't judge me to harsh, you gotta start somewhere right?
